# Forget-me-not Shaders

Pipeline shader for Canvas that adds antialiasing and better bloom. Other than that, it's mostly vanilla. You are free to use this as a template or tutorial pack for your own projects.

## how to use third-party shaders with canvas
1. Be sure you're on 1.18.2 or above. Support is not guaranteed for versions that Canvas doesn't actively support.
2. Install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) and get some cool mods that you like
3. Get Canvas Renderer mod through [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/canvas). **Keep in mind that Canvas does not work with Sodium, Iris, OptiFine, or OptiFabric.**
4. Download your preferred pipeline shaderpack
5. Launch your game, put your pipeline resource pack into your resource packs folder and enable the resource pack.
6. Activate your pipeline in `Options / Video Settings / Canvas / Pipeline Options / Pipelines`
